## How Can I Contribute?

This project uses **Google OAuth** for authentication. To run the app locally, you'll need to configure your own Google API credentials.  

### Clone the repo
1. On Windows: We recommend that you use WSL2. [Installation instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). 
2. On Windows: start WSL 
3. In Github, fork the repository
4. Clone this fork  using ```git clone https://github.com/lnovitz/jobseeker-analytics.git```
5. ```cd jobseeker-analytics``` into the repo you just cloned

### Get a Google AI API key
1. Go to [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Click **Create and API Key**
3. Copy your API key and save it for later

---

### Create a Google OAuth App 
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).  
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**.  
3. If this is your first time creating credentials with this project, you will have to configure the OAuth consent screen.
4. On the OAuth Consent Screen page, scroll to "Test Users" and add your gmail address.
3. Click **Create Credentials** → **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**.  
4. Set the application type to **Web Application**.  
5. Under "Authorized redirect URIs," add:  
   - https://jobseeker-analytics.onrender.com/login
   - http://localhost:8000/login
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for later.  
7. Download and save your credentials locally to the `backend` folder for this repo in a file named ```credentials.json```

---

### Set Up Environment Variables
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:  
   ```ini
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
   COOKIE_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   DB_HOST=your-db-host-here
   DB_NAME=your-db-name-here
   DB_USER=your-db-user-here
   DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password-here
   ```
   **🔒 Never share your `.env` file or commit it to Git!**  

---


### Run the App

Once your `.env` file is set up, start the app by following the instructions below:
1. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```sh
   # MAC/LINUX
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   ```sh
   # WINDOWS (CMD)
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```
4. Run backend and frontend apps:
   In one terminal window, run:
   ```bash
   cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   In another terminal window, run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```
6. Check it out @:
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
   
Then, visit `http://localhost:8000/login` to test the authentication flow.  

You can view logs from the app by finding your container in Docker Desktop/Docker Engine and clicking on it. The app will automatically refresh when you make changes. 
---

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Not redirected after login?**  
  Double-check your `REDIRECT_URI` in both `.env` and Google Cloud settings.  
- **Invalid API key errors?**  
  Some Google APIs require API key restrictions—try generating a new unrestricted key for local testing.  
- **Cannot Build Docker Image?**
   Try option 2, with venv and FastAPI server instead.

### Submit Changes  
1. **Fork** this repository.  
2. **Clone** your fork:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
- use branch convention <feature|bugfix|hotfix|docs>/<issueNumber>-<issueDescription>
   ```sh
   git checkout -b docs/65-add-contribution-guidelines
   ```
4. **Make your changes** and commit them:  
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add submission guidelines and env setup"
   ```
   Note: if you end up using a new Python library (e.g. I just added `ruff`) with `pip install`, be sure to do the following from the `backend` folder:
   `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

   You will need to add the `requirements.txt` file change as a commit, to ensure the environment has all its dependencies and production and local development environments run smoothly.
   ```sh
   git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "add python library ruff"
   ```

5. **Format your changes** and commit them:

- If you're using Python, run:
   ```sh
   ruff format path/to/your/code
   git add .
   git commit -m "format with ruff"
   ```
(Please ensure your code passes all linting checks before submitting a pull request.)

6. **Push to your fork**:  
   ```sh
   git push origin docs/65-add-contribution-guidelines
   ```
7. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub.  

Please ensure your changes align with the project's goals and do your best to follow the below coding style guides.
- Python: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html
- TypeScript: https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html

#### For Linux:
```bash
npm run build:linux
```
This creates:
- `dist/email-client.AppImage` (portable)
